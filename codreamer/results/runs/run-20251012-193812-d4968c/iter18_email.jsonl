{"subject": "Quick note: Secure a 20-minute discovery call", "body": "Evaluating AI models, particularly synthetic data models, can be challenging due to the need for diverse and representative test datasets. \nSynthetic data is artificially created data that mimics real data, used to train machine learning models when real data is scarce or contains privacy concerns. \nDataset bias mitigation refers to techniques used to reduce or eliminate biases present in datasets used for training machine learning models. \nPoorly annotated data can lead to inaccurate or unreliable AI models. \nActive learning is a machine learning technique where the algorithm selectively queries the user or some other information source (like a data labeler) to obtain labels for new data points.\n\nGoal: Secure a 20-minute discovery call", "citations": ["active-learning-strategies-a41fffb6", "ai-model-evaluation-metrics-de443b2b", "data-annotation-quality-dd371b9b", "dataset-bias-mitigation-a11b9b28", "gans-for-synthetic-data-3b3e889c", "model-evaluation-challenges-3988669a", "model-parameter-optimization-bbf020eb", "synthetic-data-advantages-a323213a", "synthetic-data-bias-8ffce812", "synthetic-data-generation-b10d1b81"]}
